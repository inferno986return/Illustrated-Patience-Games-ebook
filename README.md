# The Illustrated Book of Patience Games

This is a template for the *Illustrated Book of Patience Games* by Professor Hoffman. Feel free to use it for your own projects.

## Compiling

My setup for generating an ePub merely uses Python, epubcheck and GNU Bash.

A new ePub file can be made by using the provided `CreateE-book.py` via installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then ~~running the script on IDLE, [Thonny](http://thonny.org/) or~~ the `python3 CreateE-book.py` command on GNU Bash (macOS and GNU/Linux Terminal). The script however **does not** work with Python 2 and I have no plans to backport.

XHTML, CSS and the `metadata.json` files can be edited using a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

The `toc.ncx` and `content.opf` are generated by the `CreateE-book.py` and shouldn't be edited as they would be overwritten.

If you need to check the e-book yourself run `java -jar epubcheck.jar IllustratedGames.epub` from on the GNU Bash terminal (macOS and GNU/Linux) after moving to the folder that the ePub file is placed in.

I personally combine the commands by running `python3 CreateE-book.py && java -jar epubcheck.jar IllustratedGames.epub` to streamline things.
