		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>AKE out, in the first place, the aces of both packs, and lay them in a horizontal row; then above them deal out from the remaining cards (after having duly shuffled and cut) two rows of four each. The eight aces are to form the foundations of as many families, to be built up of cards in ascending sequence, but alternate in colour, a red card following a black, a black a red, and so on throughout. The four cards of the upper row are to form the bases of auxiliary heaps, to be also formed of cards of alternate colours, but in <i>descending</i> order of sequence.</p>
		<p>Having formed your <i>tableau</i> in manner above described (as shown in our illustration), you proceed to examine whether either of the cards in the upper row is <i>in ascending sequence, and opposite in colour</i> to either of the foundation cards, and if so, you at once play it thereto. Any vacancies thereby created in the upper row of auxiliary cards are forthwith filled up by cards from the lower row. You then further note whether any of the cards of the lower row are playable, in <i>descending</i> sequence and alternate colour, on either of those of the upper row. Should such be the case, you place them accordingly, so as to form auxiliary sequences, to be transferred, as soon as the uppermost card renders it practicable, to one or other of the foundations. The vacancies produced by this means in the lower row are filled up with cards from the pack.</p>
		<p>The remaining cards are dealt one by one to a waste-heap, any which may be suitable in point of value and colour being played, in accordance with the rules above laid down, to the foundations or auxiliary heaps, as the case may be.</p>
		<p class="bottom">You are entitled to deal <i>once</i> through the waste-heap. Unless by the time you have done this you have succeeded in placing all the cards and completing the eight sequences, from ace to king inclusive, you have lost the game.</p>
