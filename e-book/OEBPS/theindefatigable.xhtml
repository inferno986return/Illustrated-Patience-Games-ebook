		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">Y</span>OU remove from the pack the four aces, lay them in a horizontal row, and having shuffled and cut the remaining cards, divide them into twelve packets of four cards each, which you range face upwards, below the four principal cards (the aces) as shown in our illustration.</p>
		<p>If, among the uppermost cards of the twelve heaps, there chance to be one of like suit and in ascending sequence to either of the foundation cards (in the first instance a <i>two</i>) you lay it upon such foundation card, and proceed in like manner with any other available cards. Should two or more of the exposed cards be alike in suit, and in sequence as between themselves (as the three and four of spades in the figure) you lay the one upon the other (the smaller on the larger), so that when opportunity serves, you may be able to place them in reverse order on the packet in course of formation on the corresponding ace.</p>
		<p>If, proceeding as above, you come to a stand-still, you gather the twelve lower heaps into one (the last heap uppermost), and again divide them into as many heaps, of four cards each, as their reduced quantity will admit of: this you may repeat as often as necessary. But if you have more than once dealt through the stock without placing a single card, the game is lost, for you cannot possibly succeed.</p>
