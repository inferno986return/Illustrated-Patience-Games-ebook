		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">Y</span>OU pick out from the two packs all <i>fives</i> and <i>sixes</i>, and arrange them in a circle as shown in the figure, taking care that the five and six of the same suit shall always be together, the six to the right hand<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a> of the five. The suits should be in alternate order, so that a pair of black cards shall throughout come next to a pair of red ones.</p> <p>You then shuffle the remaining cards and deal them one by one to a waste-heap, in the centre of the circle. If in the course of such deal a card appears of like suit and in ascending sequence to either of the sixes you play it thereto. If a card appears of like suit and in descending sequence to either of the fives, it is laid upon such <i>five</i>, and so on. For example, on the six of hearts you lay the seven of hearts, eight, and so on up to knave and queen; on the <i>five</i> you place the four, three, and so on down to ace, and on the ace the king. So that finally the “right-hand” heaps will be each crowned with a king, the “left-hand” heaps with a queen.</p>
		<p class="bottom">You are entitled to deal twice through the waste-heap. If by that time you have succeeded in placing all the cards the game is won.</p>
