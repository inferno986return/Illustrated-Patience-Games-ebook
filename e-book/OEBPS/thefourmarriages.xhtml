Look them over, and if any are duplicates in the point of value, return one of them to the pack, and take another, so that the thirteen cards, though not arranged in any regular order, shall in fact form a complete sequence, irrespective of suit. Place these thirteen cards, squared together, face upwards on the table.</p>
