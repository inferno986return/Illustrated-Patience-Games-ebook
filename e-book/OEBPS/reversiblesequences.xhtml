		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HIS is an exceptionally good game, giving much scope for the excercise of thought and judgment. You begin by dealing out the whole of the cards, face upwards, in four rows of thirteen. The cards of the row nearest to you are known as “free” cards, and when either is removed, making a gap in the row above it in turn becomes a free card, <i>i.e.</i>, available for play. When this is removed, the next beyond it becomes free, and so on.</p>
