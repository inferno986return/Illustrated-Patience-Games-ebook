		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE pack having been first thoroughly shuffled, you deal four cards face upwards on the table. If there are among them two of the same suit, you cover these with two other cards from the pack. You then again take notice whether any two of the cards now exposed are of the same suit, and if so cover them with two more cards from the pack, and continue in like manner till the pack is exhausted.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If, in the course of play, the four exposed cards at any given moment are all of different suits, you can go no further; you have lost the game.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>
