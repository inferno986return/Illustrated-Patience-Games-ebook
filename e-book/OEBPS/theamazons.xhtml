		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">Y</span>OUR first step in this case is to remove from the pack the four kings, which are not made use of in this game, but are thrown aside as <i>dead</i> cards.</p>
		<p>The cards having been duly shuffled and cut, you turn up the four uppermost and lay them side by side on the table. (These are represented by the <i>lower</i> row in the annexed diagram.) If among these four cards there chance to be an ace you place it to the left hand, just above the first card of your row, completing the row with another card, and then proceed to deal one by one, on the four cards of such lower row, the remaining cards of the pack. The aces you will place, as they present themselves, to the right of the first ace, forming the upper row of the diagram. Upon the aces you will place (as they chance to turn up) the sevens,<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a> then the eights, nines, tens, and knaves, and finally the queens of their respective suits.</p>
		<p>You are not, however, entitled to place a given card upon the heap founded on the corresponding ace unless the card in question chances to fall to the packet vertically beneath such ace.</p>
		<p>The object of this patience is to form, with the entire pack, four families, each comprising a complete suit, commencing with ace and terminating with queen.</p>
		<p>After having dealt all the cards to the four packets of the lower row, you pick them up again, placing each of the three other heaps upon the left hand heap, but without disturbing the existing order of the cards.</p>
		<p>You then again deal the cards in four heaps, and continue as above until each card has found a place in its proper sequence.</p>
		<p>In dealing, when you play a card upon one of the sequences, you must take note of the place it would, but for that circumstance, have occupied. Such place should remain vacant, the next card being dealt to the heap following.</p>
		<p>Whenever you are able to complete a given suit up to queen inclusive, you put aside the family so completed, thenceforth proceeding with three packets only, and so on till you have won the game, <i>i.e.</i>, till you have each suit assembled in due order, commencing with ace and ending with queen.</p>
		<p class="bottom">But if, twice in succession, you have dealt through the remainder of the pack without having been able to add a single card to either of the sequences, you have lost the game.</p>
