		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE pack having been shuffled and cut, you take the five uppermost cards one by one, and place them before you in a horizontal row, face downwards. You proceed to deal on these five cards another five, also face downwards, and repeat as long as the pack holds out. You will thus have five heaps, of which the first two contain eleven, the last three <i>ten</i> cards each.</p>
		<p>You now take up the first heap, and see what the bottom card is. If it chance to be a <i>court card</i>, an <i>ace</i> or a <i>ten</i> (which in this game are equivalent to court cards) you replace the heap, but with the court card uppermost on the table, as shown in our illustration. If the exposed card is neither court card, ace, nor ten, you take off and throw aside the cards one by one, until such a card appears, and then replace the heap, with such card uppermost. You proceed in like manner with the four other heaps, rejecting the uppermost cards till you come to a court card, ace or ten <i>of the same suit</i> as that of the first heap. If any heap chance to contain neither ace, ten nor court card of the required suit, you reject it altogether.</p>
		<p>This done, you gather up the remaining heaps (these may still be five, or any less number), and without disturbing the order of the cards, deal again face downwards, but this time into four heaps only, and proceed as before (regarding only the suit already determined), then deal the remaining cards into three heaps. Discard as before, and deal in two heaps, and finally in one heap only, which should after the discard consist of only the ace, king, queen, knave and ten of the given suit, all other cards having been thrown out. If, on the contrary, other cards are intermingled with these, you have lost the game.</p>
