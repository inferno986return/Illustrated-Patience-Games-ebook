		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE eight aces are in the first place removed from the perpendicular rows up the centre of the table. These are to form the foundations for eight series of cards in regular ascending sequence, but without distinction of suit, and headed by king.</p>
		<p>The remaining cards are now shuffled and cut, and from them is dealt out, on either side of the aces, a perpendicular row of auxiliary cards, represented in the diagram by outlines. If in so doing you chance to turn up a card (of no matter what suit) which is playable, in ascending sequence, on either of the foundation cards <i>in the same horizontal line with it</i>, it must be played accordingly, its place in the ranks of the auxiliaries being supplied by the next card that comes to hand. Beside the two perpendicular rows of auxiliary cards, you next proceed to lay out fresh rows, also face upwards, as many as the number of cards will permit, always remembering as you do so that any card playable, according to the rules above laid down, is to be at once played accordingly. You must, however, bear in mind that whenever a fresh perpendicular row of auxiliary cards is dealt, the cards of the inner rows are thereby for the time being barred, and are no longer available.</p>
		<p>When you have dealt out the whole of the cards, you have thenceforth the right to group together any available cards of the two outer rows, irrespective of suit, in auxiliary sequences, ascending or descending. Any card removed for this purpose naturally frees for use the adjoining card of the next row, and when the last placed of a number of cards so grouped together becomes playable to one of the foundations, the rest of the series can of course be played. In turn, upon it. You must therefore strive by this means to set free such cards as may be suitable for playing to the foundations.</p>
		<p>Whenever, by means of such transpositions, you are able to clear away a whole horizontal row, you are allowed to transfer to the vacant space any card you please, provided always that it is the outermost of its horizontal row.</p>
		<p class="bottom">The cards can only be dealt once through. To win the game, you must have duly played every card, and completed the eight sequences, to king inclusive.</p>
