		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been thoroughly shuffled and cut (this should be done without fail before commencing any Patience Game<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a>), you'll divide them into eight heaps of four cards each, face downwards.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a></p>
		<p>You then turn over and expose the top card of the heap. If among the eight cards thus exposed there are two alike, <i>e.g.</i> two sevens, two queens, or two aces, you throw them aside, and turn up the cards next following them on the tops of their respective heaps. You proceed in like manner, throwing aside all the cards and supplying their places by turning up the cards next following, until the eight heaps are exhausted.</p>
		<p>If you are able to pair all the cards of the pack in this manner, the game is won, but if at any given period there are among the eight cards exposed no two of the like value, it is lost.</p>
