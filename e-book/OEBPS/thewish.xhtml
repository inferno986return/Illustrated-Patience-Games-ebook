		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been thoroughly shuffled and cut (this should be done without fail before commencing any Patience Game<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a>), you'll divide them into eight heaps of four cards each, face downwards.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a></p>
		<p>You then turn over and expose the top card of the heap. If among the eight cards thus exposed there are two alike, <i>e.g.</i> two sevens, two queens, or two aces, you throw them aside, and turn up the cards next following them on the tops of their respective heaps. You proceed in like manner, throwing aside all the cards and supplying their places by turning up the cards next following, until the eight heaps are exhausted.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If you are able to pair all the cards of the pack in this manner, the game is won, but if at any given period there are among the eight cards exposed no two of the like value, it is lost.</p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> It will be found that throughout the book the reader is constantly reminded of the necessity for shuffling. This is all-important in Patience Games, such games from their very nature having a tendeticy to group the cards in sequences or other desired combinations. Unless the cards are thoroughly shuffled, such combinations remain wholly or partly unbroken, giving the player a tremendous advantage when he makes a second attempt. The kind of shuffling which suffices for most other forms of card games is utterly inadequate for Patience Games. Cavendish recommends for this purpose (the shuffle called by French players “<i>la salade</i>”. The cards are spread face downwards on the table and then mixed with the lips of the fingers, moving round and round in circles, but in opposite directions, and at varying distances from the centre. The method which the writer himself advocates is as follows :—</p>

		<ol class="ref">
			<li>First lightly shuffle the cards in the ordinary way, then deal, some little distance apart, (three cards, face downwards; on these three more, and beside them a fourth card.</li>
			<li>The next time deal <i>five</i> cards, the next <i>six</i>, increasing the number of cards dealt by <i>one</i> each time, till you have seven heaps of various sizes on the table.</li>
			<li>From this point deal in the opposite direction, one card on each heap; gather up the heaps haphazard, and however systematically the cards may have been arranged at the outset, their order will be found to be broken in the most effectual manner.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="ref top"><a href="#cit-dagger" id="ref-dagger">†</a> The dealing the cards <i>face downwards</i>, and turning them up one by one, is in this case a needless complication. It will be found a better plan to deal all face upwards in the first instance, when the removal of a given card will leave the one below exposed in readiness for use.</p>
		<p class="ref">When any heap is altogether exhausted, the player is permitted to fill up the vacant space with the uppermost card of any other heap. This privilege is sometimes a valuable assistance.</p>
		<p class="ref">Another version of the same game is given by Dr. Pole (<i>Cydopædia of Card and Table Games</i>) under the name <span class="sc">6. Pairs</span>, as follows. The pack used in this case consists of 52 cards :—</p>

		<ol class="ref">
			<li>Deal out from the pack nine cards, laying them separately, face upwards. Then abstract from them any pairs (a pair means, as at cribbage, two cards of the same rank, as two queens, two threes, and so on) and throw them aside.</li>
			<li>Fill the place of the pairs withdrawn with new cards from the pack, then remove any further pairs, fill up anew, and so on.</li>
			<li>The object of the game is to abstract all the cards in this way, exhausting the pack. This can be done occasionally, as above described; but it will most frequently happen that a time will come when the nine cards before you contain no pair. You are then allowed to lay down one extra card; if this gives you a pair, you remove them, lilt up to nine, and go on as before.</li>
			<li>If a second block occurs, you may repeat the license, but if this does not succeed you lose the game.</li>
