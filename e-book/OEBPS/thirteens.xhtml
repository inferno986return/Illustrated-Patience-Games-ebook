		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE pack having been shuffled and cut, you form upon the table two vertical rows of five cards each. From the tableau thus formed, you throw out by twos, without regard to suit or position, all such cards as taken together make the number thirteen. From ace (one) up to ten, each card counts according to the number of its pips; knave counts eleven, queen twelve, and king thirteen.</p>
		<p>Having removed as above all such cards as, taken in pairs complete the number thirteen, and all kings (as being singly equivalent to that number), you replace the missing cards by others taken from the stock, and so proceed until all the cards of the pack have been worked off in like manner.</p>
		<p>If at any given moment the two rows, when duly filled up, do not include a king, or any two cards together making thirteen, the game is lost.</p>
