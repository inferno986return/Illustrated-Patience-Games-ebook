		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HIS has a pretty close resemblence to <span class="sc"><a href="thedemon.xhtml">7. The Demon</a></span>. Lay out eight cards in a row, face upwards. These are to form heads of columns. The nineth card turned up determines the “bases”. This and the other cards of like denomination, as they appear, are laid so as to form a second row, above the first. Should a card of the base series be among the heads of columns, it is at once removed to its proper place, and the vancancy filled by the next card from the pack.</p>
		<p>The object of the player is to form ancending suit-sequences on the bases, and descending sequences in alternate colours, on the heads of columns.</p>
