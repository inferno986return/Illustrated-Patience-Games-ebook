		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been shuffled and cut, you pick out from them the four aces, and then with the fifteen uppermost cards form a pyramid, placing the four aces two on either side, as shown in the figure.</p>
		<p>If, among the cards of the pyramid there are any which will form ascending sequences to either of the aces, you place them on such aces accordingly. You must however take care to follow suit, playing only heart on heart, spade on spade, and so on. The blank spaces thereby created in the pyramid you fill up from the cards in your hand, and deal the remaining cards to a waste-heap, from which alone all future blanks are to be filled up.</p>
		<p>The object of the game is to build up upon each ace the complete suit, terminating with the king. If after one re-deal of the waste-heap, you have not succeeded in doing this, you have lost the game.</p>
