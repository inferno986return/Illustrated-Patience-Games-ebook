		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">L</span>AY out four aces and four kings, one of each suit, in two rows, as shown in our illustration. (These cards are destined to serve as foundations for complete families of like suit, the aces for series in ascending, the kings in descending sequence.)</p>
		<p>You shuffle the remaining cards, and form therewith four separate heaps, one below each king, and beside them a waste-heap, all face upwards. The first card falls each time to the first heap, the second to the second heap, the third to the third, and the fourth to the fourth heap; you then count off the fifth and sixth, and deal them to the waste-heap. The positions of the four auxiliary heaps are shown in the diagram by outline cards; that of the waste-heap by a card marked accordingly.</p>
		<p>If among the four auxiliary cards or the two belonging to the waste-heap any card should present itself which is of like suit and in ascending sequence to either of the aces, or of like suit and in descending sequence to either of the kings, it is at once played to its proper position accordingly.</p>
		<p>When there is no longer on the table any card which can be played to either of the families, you deal as before fresh cards to the auxiliary heaps, <i>i.e.</i>, you distribute one each to the first, second, third and further heaps, and two to the waste-heap. If in so doing you turn up a card available for either of the sequences, you play it thereto accordingly, but you do not on that account disturb the order of distribution; for example, if the card dealt second, and which would therefore in ordinary course fall to the second heap, is instead played to one of the foundations, the card next following will still be regarded as number three, and dealt to the third heap.</p>
		<p>The uppermost card for the time being of the waste-heap may (as is indeed the rule in all Patience games) be likewise played, if appropriate, to either of the foundations. The four heaps are reserves, upon which you may draw at any convenient opportunity, and each card removed from the top of a heap makes the one beneath it in turn available for use.</p>
		<p>When you have gone through all the cards, you spread out the cards of the waste-heap on the table, and, without distinction of order, play any that may be suitable to the appropriate foundations. This done, you take the remaining cards both of the waste-heap and the four auxiliary heaps, shuffle them, and make a second (and after this, if needful, a third) distribution of the cards, according to the rules above laid down, which remain obligatory throughout the game.</p>
		<p>If after the third deal there are still cards unplaced, even a fourth deal is permissible. This is known as the “grace”. In this last deal, however, there is no waste-heap.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If after this there are still cards outstanding, which you have been unable to place with their respective families, the game is lost.</p>
