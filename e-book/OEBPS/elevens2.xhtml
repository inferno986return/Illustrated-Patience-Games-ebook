		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> There is yet a third method of playing the "Eleven" game, which combines the principal features of the two methods above described.</p>
		<p class="ref">The whole pack is shuffled and cut. Nine cards are laid, in rows of three, lace upwards. Any two cards tt^elher making eleven are covered with fresh cards as last above described. King, queen and knave, ixpsstd limultaneausly, aaj all Ihree be covered in like manner. No second deal is allowed.</p>
		<p class="ref">Sometimes it will be found at the close that a single card remains in the hand. Should such card pair with one of those exposed (otherwise unpaired) to make eleven, the game is won, as if the whole had been played. More usually, however, the iinal tableau, in the event of success, exhibits a sequence of king, queen, knave, and six other cards combining in couples to form elevens.</p>
