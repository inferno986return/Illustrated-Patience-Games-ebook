		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">H</span>AVING thrown out the kings, queens and knaves, remaining cards; place the rejected court cards below the cut, so that they shall be the last cards of the pack. Then take the cards one by one, commencing from the top, and lay out upon the table three rows of four cards each, face upwards as shown in the figure.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If among the cards so exposed there are two (irrespective of suit or position) whose pips added together make eleven, you will place upon these two the two uppermost cards of the stock, and proceed in the same manner until (if you are lucky) the twelve court cards, the last of the stock, have been fully distributed, each covering one of the twelve heaps.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> There is yet a third method of playing the "Eleven" game, which combines the principal features of the two methods above described.</p>
		<p class="ref">The whole pack is shuffled and cut. Nine cards are laid, in rows of three, lace upwards. Any two cards tt^elher making eleven are covered with fresh cards as last above described. King, queen and knave, ixpsstd limultaneausly, aaj all Ihree be covered in like manner. No second deal is allowed.</p>
		<p class="ref">Sometimes it will be found at the close that a single card remains in the hand. Should such card pair with one of those exposed (otherwise unpaired) to make eleven, the game is won, as if the whole had been played. More usually, however, the iinal tableau, in the event of success, exhibits a sequence of king, queen, knave, and six other cards combining in couples to form elevens.</p>
