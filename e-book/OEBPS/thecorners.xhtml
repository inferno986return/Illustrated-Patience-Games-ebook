		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE pack having been duly shuffled and cut, you lay out in three rows the nine top cards. The cards at corners must be of different suits, but their value is immaterial. These four are the foundation cards, the others the auxiliaries. The remainder of the pack is placed, face downwards, on the centre card of the lower row.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>
		<p>If one of the auxiliary cards chance to be of same suit, and in ascending sequence to one of the corner cards, it is laid thereon, and its place supplied from the stock. In like manner with any card of the stock which when turned up is found to be of like suit and in ascending sequence with any of the corner cards for the time being: it is forthwith placed thereon.</p>
		<p class="bottom">You may run through the stock three times, but if by that time all the cards are not duly placed you have lost the game.</p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> This is a chance lost throughout to the player. It will be found a better plan to keep the stock quite apait from the <i>tableau</i>.</p>
