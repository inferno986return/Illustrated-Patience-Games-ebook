		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">P</span>ICK out in the first place from one of the packs the four aces and four kings, and place the aces to the left and the kings to the right, in vertical rows, leaving between them room for horizontal rows of ten cards each. The kings each serve as foundations for descending sequences headed by ace of their respective suits, while each ace will form the foundation of an ascending sequence of its own suit, ending with king.</p>
		<p>After having duly shuffled and cut the remaining cards you lay out face upwards a row of ten auxiliary cards, as shown in our illustration. You examine whether among such ten cards there arc any which (duly following suit) can be played in ascending sequence to either of the aces, or in descending sequence to either of the kings, and if so, transfer them to their proper positions accordingly. The vacancies thus arising In the row of auxiliary cards are filled up from the stock, Vou then deal beneath the first a second row of ten auxiliary cards, and make use of any of them which may prove to be available, again tilling up the vacancies from the stock.</p>
		<p>You proceed to lay out, below the first two, a third row of ten auxiliary cards, but you are now no longer permitted to remove cards lying in the second or middle row. You can only use such cards as may be available in the first or third row, subject to the qualification that any card removed from either of these two rows liberates the card above or beneath it, so that such card may then be used.</p>
		<p>After supplying the vacancies left by the cards first employed, you proceed to deal, one by one, fresh rows of ten auxiliary cards below their predecessors. These (to the number of four rows)<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a> are represented in the illustration by outline cards. From each of these rows, in turn, you proceed to pick out such cards as may be playable to either of the foundations, but you are in each case bound, so far as the intermediate rows are concerned, by the same restrictions as were laid down in connection with the third row.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a> When you have made certain that no further card of the available rows can be played to either of the sequences, you supply the places of the removed cards from the pack, first completing the uppermost row, then the second, and so on.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If when you have laid out the whole of the cards, there are no cards left in either the first or last row, which can be played to the sequences, you have lost the game. If, on the other hand, you have been enabled to play all the cards, and have on one side four aces, completing series beginning with king, and four kings, completing series beginning with ace, the game is won.</p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> It most be clearly understood that the player is not limited to a total of five rows. After dealing out each fresh row, he proceeds to play all such cards as may be thereby rendered playable, fills up the blank spaces, and then deals another row, until the whole of the cards are exhausted. There is in this case no waste-heap.</p>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-dagger" id="ref-dagger">†</a> You can only use cards from the <i>first and last</i> rows for the time being; but so soon as such card is removed, the card immediately above or below it becomes available.</p>
