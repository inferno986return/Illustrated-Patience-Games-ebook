		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been thoroughly shuffled, you pick out the four twos, and lay them before you in a horizontal row. The second row, which you form below the first, will consist of the four uppermost cards of those left in hand. These are auxiliary cards. Now count off thirteen cards, and lay them in a heap to the left, face upwards: these form the store-house.</p>
		<p>You now begin to turn up the remaining cards, one by one. All cards of like suit and in ascending sequence to the four twos of the upper row, are laid upon such twos. Any card of like suit and in descending sequence to either of the auxiliary cards will be laid upon such card. The minor sequences thus formed will be transferred to the appropriate foundation as soon as the uppermost card (as being of like suit and in ascending sequence) becomes playable thereto. Any vacancies should be at once filled from the waste-heap. The top card for the time being of the store-house, however, has the preference over any other; you must always therefore play this card when you can, either to one of the principal heaps, or on one of the auxiliaries.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If at the close of the game you have succeeded in completing each suit in regular sequence from <i>two</i> up to <i>ace</i> inclusive, you have won. To this end, you are entitled to deal through the pack, if needful, three times.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>

			<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> A slightly different version of the same Patience is given by Dr. Pole in <i>The Cyclopædia of Card and Table Games</i>, under the title of <span class="sc">13. Auxiliary Sequences</span>, as follows:—</p>
			<p class="ref">First lay out the four aces, which are to be filled up by sequences, <i>following suit</i>, ascending to kings.</p>
			<p class="ref">In front of these there are to be placed a row of four cards, face upwards, which are lo be covered by <i>auxiliary sequences</i>, descending, and regardless of suit; these form four <i>auxiliary heaps</i>.</p>
			<p class="ref">Having laid out cards fanning the bases of these heaps, you go on dealing, and when cards appear suitable either for the main or for the auxiliary sequences, they are put in their proper places. Unsuitable cards are placed face upwards in a waste-heap. The main sequences are filled up from the auxiliary sequences, or by dealing from the pad, or from the top card of the waste-heap, which is always available.</p>
			<p class="ref">The auxiliary sequences are allowed many modifications of treatment, which give scope for much skill in choice, viz. —</p>

			<ol>
				<li class="ref">Any top card of any auxiliary heap maybe removed to the lop of any other auxiliary heap with which it forms a descending sequence, <i>e.g.</i> a four may be removed and put on the top of a live, a knave on a queen, and so on.</li>
				<li class="ref">This may also be done with any sequence already exisling; <i>e.g.</i> a ten, nine, and eight, forming an auxiliary heap, ot being at the top of any such heap, may be all removed and put on a knave at the top of any other auxiliary heap.</li>
				<li class="ref">When any auxiliary heap disappears, you may lay down a new card, or new cards, in its place, either (<i>a</i>) by dealing from the pack; or (<i>b</i>) by taking the top card of the waste-heap (or more than one if in descending sequence); or (<i>c</i>) you may move thither one or more cards in sequence from another heap; or (<i>d</i>) you may leave the space blank and open as long as you please.</li>
				<li class="ref">You may also move a top card of a main sequence on to a suitable card at the top of an auxiliary sequence, if it gives any additional facilities for arranging the cards as you want them.</li>
				<li class="ref">You are not compelled lo lay down all the four foundation cards for the auxiliary sequences at first; if you think that any cards appear unfavourable, they may go to the waste-heap, and you may wait till other cards appear. Pairs and very high cards are unfavourable.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="ref">In all these operations ihe sequences must be carefully preserved, and only the upper cards must be operated on.</p>
		<p class="ref">There is no re-deal; but if, when you have dealt all the cards, you have failed, you are allowed, as a grace, to extract anyone card at pleasure from the waste-heap, and dispose of it as if it were the top card.</p>
		<p class="ref">With due skill, the chances are in your favour; without it, they are against you.</p>
