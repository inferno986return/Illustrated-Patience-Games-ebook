		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">A</span>FTER having duly shuffled and cut the pack, you proceed as follows: you lay on the table the four uppermost cards, face upwards, in the form of a cross, sufficiently far apart to enable you to place the next four cards, also face upwards, between them. You have thus an octagonal figure, with each of its eight sides consisting of a single card having duly shuffled and cut the pack, you proceed as follows: you lay on the table the four uppermost cards, face upwards, in the form of a cross, sufficiently far apart to enable you to place the next four cards, also face upwards, between them. You have thus an octagonal figure, with each of its eight sides consisting of a single card. At the outer extremity of each of these eight cards you place another, the sixteen cards thus exposed  forming a “star”, as shown in our illustration. There are still sixteen cards left of the pack. These, constituting the talon or stock, you place face downwards in the centre of the star.</p>
		<p>You now turn up the top card of the stock, and see whether, among the sixteen cards of the star, there is one which corresponds in value (irrespective of suit) with such card. If so, you pick up and throw aside the two cards thus paired. You then turn up the card next following on the stock, and proceed in like manner until all the cards of the star have in turn been paired and thrown aside with corresponding cards of the stock.</p>
		<p>If you chance to remove one of the cards of the first circle (<i>i.e.</i>, that nearest to the stock in the centre), you must replace it by the corresponding card of the outer circle, so as to keep the inner circle complete as long as you possibly can. It will happen now and then that neither of the cards of the Star will pair with the top card of the stock; in such case you are entitled to relieve yourself of this latter card by placing it in one of the vacant spaces of the outer circle. You should therefore, in order to obtain as soon as possible free spaces in the outer circle, pair cards for preference from this, rather than from the inner circle.</p>
		<p>Should the cards of the <i>talon</i> be exhausted, and there remain in the Star only duplicate cards, you remove them two by two, and the game is won. If at any given period there is among the cards of the Star no pair to the exposed card of the stock, and no vacant space in the outer circle wherein to place it, you have failed.</p>
