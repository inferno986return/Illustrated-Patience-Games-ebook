Taking the pack in hand, you turn up the three top cards and place them on the table, putting aside any Clubs which may chance to be among them. Turn up three more cards, again throwing out the Clubs, and adding them to the cards of the same suit already on the table; proceed in the same way until you have done this five times, then shuffle the cards already used (the Clubs excepted) with the rest of the pack, and proceed as before, repeating tliis process twice over.</p>
		<p>If at the close of the third operation you have extracted all the Clubs, the Patience has succeeded. If you have still any Clubs left in hand, it has failed.</p>
