Taking the pack in hand, you turn up the three top cards and place them on the table, putting aside any <i>clubs</i> which may chance to be among them. Turn up three more cards, again throwing out the <i>clubs</i>, and adding them to the cards of the same suit already on the table; proceed in the same way until you have done this five times, then shuffle the cards already used (the <i>clubs</i> excepted) with the rest of the pack, and proceed as before, repeating this process twice over.</p>
		<p>If at the close of the third operation you have extracted all the <i>clubs</i>, the Patience has succeeded. If you have still any <i>clubs</i> left in hand, it has failed.</p>
