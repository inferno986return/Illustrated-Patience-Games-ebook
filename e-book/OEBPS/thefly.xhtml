		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE eight aces are first withdrawn from the two packs, horizontal row upon the table; these are destined to form the foundations of as many complete families; rising in regular sequence, without distinction of suit, from ace to king inclusive.</p>
		<p>You then count off from the remaining cards (first duly shuffled and cut), a packet of <i>thirteen</i>, which is laid on one side face upwards, and is known as <i>The Fly</i>. You proceed to deal the rest of the cards, but instead of forming with them, as in the majority of Patience Games, a single waste-heap, you make with them <i>five</i> waste-heaps, and you are allowed to deal each card to such one of such five heaps as may appear most advantageous for your purpose. It will readily be understood that you should, whenever possible, avoid covering a low card with a higher one; and it is oflen desirable to set apart one waste-heap for kings only, seeing that, as the highest cards, they are necessarily the last to be made use of.</p>
		<p>During this distribution of the cards into five heaps you must carefully bear in mind the uppermost card of the <i>Fly</i>, and as soon as a favourable opportunity ofters, play it to one of the foundations. You do the same with the uppermost cards of the waste-heaps, always, however, giving the preference to the cards of the <i>Fly</i>. Each card played frees for use the one beneath it.</p>
		<p class="bottom">If by the time you have gone through the two packs you have not succeeded in playing all the cards of the <i>Fly</i> and of the five waste-heaps to the foundations, and therewith forming complete sequences from ace to king, you have lost the game.</p>
