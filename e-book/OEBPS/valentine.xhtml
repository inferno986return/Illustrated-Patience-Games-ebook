		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">H</span>AVING first thoroughly shuffled (the necessity of this cannot be too often insisted upon) lay out the four uppermost cards in a row, face upwards. If the card next in order is of like suit with one of the four, and in <i>ascending sequence</i> therewith, place it upon it. If in <i>descending sequence</i>, underneath it.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>
		<p>Assuming that you have been able thus to use the fifth card, see whether you can deal with the sixth in like manner. The first card which cannot be so disposed of, you place on the table beside the four others (in the position of the king in the figure). You then gather up from left to right these four cards, or the heaps in course of formation upon them, and place them underneath the <i>talon</i>, so as to become the last cards thereof. The fifth card, which you left on the table, becomes the first of a new row of four, completed by taking the three cards next uppermost on the pack. You then proceed as before.</p>
		<p class="bottom">You are entitled to deal through the stock as often as you are able to play a fresh card to either of the foundation heaps. But if you have done so several times without placing a single fresh card, the game must be regarded as hopeless.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a> To win, you must at the close have succeeded in grouping the cards of all four suits in regular order.</p>

		<hr/>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> It is hardly necessary to remark that should any of the four cards laid out as above correspond as between themselves in suit and sequence, the higher will at once be played on the lower, the vacancy being supplied by the next card on the pack.</p>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-dagger" id="ref-dagger">†</a> It will be found as the game proceeds, that the cards come out in short sequences, the effect of the gradual grouping in the early stages. Referring to the statement in the text, it is rather difficult to decide at what point the game becomes absolutely hopeless. It is in any case a long-winded affair: indeed we know of none to which the title of a Patience game is more fully (we had almost said painfully) appropriate.</p>
