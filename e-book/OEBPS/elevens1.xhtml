		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">Y</span>OU lay upon the table, face upwards, three rows of three cards each, without regard to suit or position. You then take note whether any two of such cards together make the number <i>eleven</i>, as for example, a seven and a four, an eight and a three, a nine and a two, or a ten and an ace. A king, a queen, or a knave by itself in this game counts eleven. You remove accordingly all kings, queens and knaves, as also such couples as together make eleven. The blank spaces thereby left must be supplied with fresh cards from the stock. If at any given stage of the game, when all such blanks are filled, there are no cards exposed which make the desired number, you are allowed to turn up one additional card from the stock, but if the card so drawn will not combine with either of those upon the table to make eleven, you have lost the game.</p>
