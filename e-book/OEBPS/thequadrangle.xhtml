		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been first thoroughly shuffled, you lay out, face upwards, twelve little heaps, each consisting of three cards, so as to form three sides of a sort of our illustration. This “frame” must be of such a size as to leave room within it for two more rows, of four cards each.</p>
		<p>You now cut the pack, and the first card that comes to hand on the lower portion decides what cards shall form the foundations for the intended sequences; if, for example, the first card turned up is a ten, or queen, or a seven, the corresponding cards throughout the two packs will be employed as foundations. As such cards chance to appear in the course of the deal, they are forthwith placed in their proper positions, as indicated in our diagram by the outline cards in the middle of the frame.</p>
		<p>You next examine whether any of the uppermost cards of the twelve auxiliary heaps are playable (as being of like suit and in ascending sequence) to either of the foundations. Should such be the case, you play them accordingly.</p>
		<p>You then proceed to deal the remaining cards to a waste-heap, any which may be suitable being played in due course to the foundations, or placed in descending sequence on auxiliary cards of similar suit. The removal of a card from either of the auxiliary heaps makes the one below it available for use in like manner. When any given heap is entirely exhausted, you supply the vacancy thereby created with a single card from the waste-heap.</p>
		<p class="bottom">In this game only a single deal is allowed. To win the game, you must meanwhile have succeeded in playing every card, both of the waste-heap and the auxiliary heaps, to its proper place on one or other of the eight foundations.</p>
