		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">L</span>AY out, face upwards, twenty cards, in rows of five. These constitute the “carpet”. Below these, in another row, lay the four aces, as in the diagram.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a> These are foundations.</p>
		<p>The remaining cards form the stock. If during the formation of the carpet an ace should have been turned up, it is removed at once to its proper position, and its place supplied by another card.</p>
		<p>The object of the game is to form on each of the aces a suit-sequence, up to king. For this purpose any available <i>two</i> is at once played from the carpet upon its proper ace; a <i>three</i> of the same suit on the two, and so on, the vacant spaces being filled by cards from the stock. When no futher progress can be made in this matter, the player begins to deal the cards, face upwards, to a waste-heap. So long as there are any cards in this heap, vacancies in the carpet are filled from thence, instead of from the stock in hand.</p>
		<p>The top card of the waste-heap, if suitable, may always be played to one of the sequences.</p>
		<p class="bottom">The chances of success and failure are reckoned as about equal. No second deal is therefore allowed.</p>

		<hr/>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> In this diagram, for the sake of clearness, all four aces are shown in position. In a general way, however, they would not all appear until a more advanced stage of the game, by which time those first turned up would probably have been covered.</p>
