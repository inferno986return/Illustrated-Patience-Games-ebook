		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">L</span>AY out, face upwards, twenty cards, in rows of five. These constitute the "carpet". Below these, in another row, lay the four aces, as in the diagram.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a> These are foundations.</p>

		<p>The remaining cards form the stock. If during the formation of the carpet</p>
		<p>The object of the game is to form on each of the aces a suit-sequence, up to king.</p>

		<p>The top card of the waste-heap, if suitable, may always be played to one of the sequences.</p>
		<p class="bottom">The chances of success and failure are reckoned as about equal. No second deal is therefore allowed.</p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> In this diagram, for the sake of clearness, all four aces are shown in position. In a general way, however, they would not all appear until a more advanced stage of the game, by which time those first turned up would probably have been covered.</p>
