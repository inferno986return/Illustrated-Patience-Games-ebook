		<hr class="heading-line"/>
		<h3 class="heading">(With two whist packs.)</h3>
		<hr class="short-line"/>

		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HERE is another version of the Dial, played as follows. Remove from one of the two packs an <i>ace</i>, <i>five</i> and <i>nine of diamonds</i>, a <i>two</i>, <i>six</i> and <i>ten of clubs</i>, a <i>three</i>, <i>seven</i> and <i>knave of hearts</i>, a <i>four</i>, <i>eight</i> and <i>queen of spades</i>. Arrange these twelve cards as shown in the diagram.</p>
    <p>The object of the game is to get together upon each of these cards an ascending sequence of the same suit, terminatting with the card corresponding in value to the Roman numeral placed opposite such card on the outside of the circle.</p>
    <p>You deal through the stock in the usual way, making use of such cards as may be available. The kings, which have no place in the circle, must be laid as they come to hand in the vacant spaces in the centre (see diagram). It follows that queen (=12) will in each case be immediately followed by ace (=1).</p>
    <p>You are entitled to go through the stock three times.</p>
