		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HIS game is asserted, with what truth we know not, to have been invented to amuse Napoleon Bonaparte in his captivity.</p>
		<p>The lay-out is rather elaborate. From one of your two packs, before shuffling them together, you take the four kings and the four aces, and place them before you in two rows, the king row uppermost. The shuffling the remainder of the two packs, you deal from them twelve cards face upwards (placing them round the kings and aces, as shown in the diagram), and continue to deal round and round on these until all the cards are exhausted. Before commencing the second round, however, you note carefully whether any of the cards just dealt are playable to either of the two central rows, the object of the player being to form descending suit-sequences on the four kings, and ascending suit-sequences on the four aces.</p>
		<p>This however, is to be done subject to the following restrictions. â€“ Cards in the top row are only available to be played to the "king" series; and cards in the bottom row only to the "ace" series.</p>
