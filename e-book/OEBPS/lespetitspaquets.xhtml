		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">Y</span>OU remove from the united packs the eight kings, and lay them, by way of foundation cards, in two rows, as shown in the diagram. On the four kings of the upper row must be laid, first the corresponding aces, then the twos, then the threes, and so on up to queen. On the four kings in the lower row are to come first their respective queens, then the knaves, and so on down to ace inclusive.</p>
		<p>Thirteen cards are now dealt out from the stock in hand, twelve of them in two horizontal rows, and the thirteenth a little to one side. On these thirteen you deal thirteen more, the first twelve in such manner that each shall be squarely on the corresponding card already placed, but the thirteenth fanwise, in such manner that the card first dealt to that heap shall still remain visible.</p>
		<p>You continue in the same manner until all the cards are dealt. At each deal, however, you must carefully observe the instructions following:—</p>
		<p>Each of the thirteen heaps is considered to bear a number in regular succession: thus the first heap to the left is regarded as No. 1, the next as No. 2, and so on up to the heap spread fanwise, which will be number thirteen. Whenever the actual value of the card dealt proves to be the same as the number of the heap to which it is dealt, it is turned over and laid on one side. (An ace is reckoned for this purpose as <i>one</i>, a knave as <i>eleven</i>, and a queen as <i>twelve</i>.) Whenever a card is thus laid on one side, the next card dealt takes its place. And so the deal proceeds, every card whose value corresponds with the number of its heap being turned over and put aside as above mentioned. Each round of the deal commences with heap 1, and ends at heap 13.</p>
		<p>When the whole of the cards have been dealt out in this manner, it is to be borne in mind that <i>all</i> the cards of the thirteenth heap (which it will be remembered was dealt on one side, and in such manner that the faces of all its cards remain visible) are available for use, but in the case of the other twelve heaps only the <i>uppermost</i> cards for the time being. When the uppermost card has been played, then, and not till then, may its successor be dealt with.</p>
		<p>Any suitable cards are laid as above described on the eight kings; that is to say, on the four of the uppermost rows: first the aces of the same suit, then the twos, and so on; on those of the lower row first the queens of same suit, then the knaves, and so on.</p>
		<p>When there is no longer any card which you can play in this fashion, you take the uppermost card of the “turned over” heap which you put aside in the course of the deal, and place it (unless it chances to be playable to one or other of the foundations, in which case other cards of the thirteen heaps will probably be rendered available) under that particular heap with whose number it chances to agree; for instance, if the card turned up is a <i>four</i>, you place It under the <i>fourth</i> heap in the first row; if it is a knave you place it under the last heap but one in the second row. Then the uppermost card of this latter heap is dealt with in the same way, that is to say, it is placed under that heap with whose number its value corresponds, and you proceed in like manner until you are enabled to play to the foundations some one of the uppermost cards.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a> You must then anew carefully examine the thirteen heaps, and if any other cards have become playable to the foundations under the altered conditions of the game, play them accordingly.</p>
		<p>When it is no longer possible to do this, the next card of the turned-down heap comes into play. You proceed with this as with its predecessor, and in like manner one after another with the remaining “turned” cards, until they are completely exhausted.</p>
		<p>If you have not by this time succeeded in effecting the object of the game, you may gather up the thirteen heaps, and deal them once (or even twice) again, in the same manner as before. In gathering them up, however, bear in mind that the six heaps of the upper row are to be placed one upon the other, and the six of the lower row in like manner, one upon the other, the cards of the thirteenth heap (or such of them as may remain) being placed <i>between</i> the two packets thus made.<a href="#ref-doubledagger" id="cit-doubledagger">‡</a></p>
		<p class="bottom">With regard to the main sequences, it is allowable, if it appears likely to assist in bringing the game to a successful issue, to take a card from the upper row, and place it on a corresponding card of the lower row, or <i>vice versâ</i>. For example, if one of the main sequences in the upper row is headed by a seven of clubs, and one in the lower row by an eight of clubs, and on one of the thirteen heaps there is a six of clubs, which you desire to make use of, you may shift the seven in the upper on to the eight in the lower row. The six is thereby rendered playable. <i>Only one card at a time</i>, however, can be dealt with in this manner.</p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> It will be observed that the illustration represents a great part of the two packs as already distributed to the thirteen heaps. Before reaching this stage, sundry cards would in all probability have already been played the various foundations, but it has been thought better to ignore this in the diagram, so that there may he no mistake as to the position of the kings.</p>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-dagger" id="ref-dagger">†</a> It will be observed that <i>each</i> step of this process makes a new top card, of another heap, available for play.</p>
		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-doubledagger" id="ref-doubledagger">‡</a> This plan ensures a completely new arrangement of the cards after redistribution.</p>
