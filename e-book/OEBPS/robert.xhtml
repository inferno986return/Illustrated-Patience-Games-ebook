		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE pack having been properly shuffled and cut, you turn up the first card, and place it on the table. If such first card is, say, a <i>ten</i>, and that next following is a <i>nine</i> or a <i>knave</i>, (of any suit), you lay this card upon the ten. If on the other hand you draw a card which is not in sequence, ascending or descending, with that first drawn, you throw it aside to a waste-heap.</p>
		<p>If you have placed a <i>nine</i> on the ten, you will place on this nine the first <i>eight</i> or <i>ten</i> which may be turned up. If you	had placed on the ten a <i>knave</i>, you would place on this card the first <i>ten</i> or <i>queen</i> which might come to hand, without distinction of suit, and so continue till you have worked quite through the pack.</p>
		<p>You are entitled to deal three times through the waste-heap. If after you have done so, there are still cards not in sequence the game is lost.</p>
