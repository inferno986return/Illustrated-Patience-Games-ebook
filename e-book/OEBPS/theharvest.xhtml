		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">H</span>AVING shuffled and cut the cards, you arrange them, as indicated by the diagram, in rows of eight cards each, dealt after the following manner. You count “seven” for the first card, “eight” for the second, “nine” for the third, and so on up to the eighth card, which you call “ace”. After “ace” you begin again to count “seven”, “eight”, and so on. Whenever it chances that the card turned up corresponds with the value called (<i>e.g.</i>, if the card called “seven” be a seven, or the card called "knave" be a knave), you take it up and put it on one side.</p>
		<p class="bottom">Starting with the next card, you again begin to count “seven”, and so on until the whole of the pack has been dealt This done, you pick up the stock afresh and deal again, counting from the number at which you stopped. This you may repeat as often as you please, till every card has in turn answered to its number, and been thrown out, in which case you have won the game. But if you have more than once, each time starting from seven, called over the remaining stock without any card answering to its number, you have failed.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>

	<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> This is most likely to happen when the remaining cards are eight, or some multiple of eight, in number; for if in such case (say) “seven” was called to the first card, and neither of the eight cards has been thrown out, the first card wilt again be seven, and the same result will necessarily be repeated.</p>
