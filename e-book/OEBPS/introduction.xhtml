		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">P</span>ATIENCE GAMES, as the term is usually understood, are card games for a single player who plays against fate or chance, represented by the more or less favourable arrangement of the cards at the outset of the game.</p>

		<p class="top">“The player at starting sets himself the task to arrange the cards in some particular manner; then, taking the pack in the accidental state determined by thorough shuffling, he attempts to  carry out his design, conforming, however, to certain rules of play” — varying with the particular game — “which materially restrict the facilities of his operation. The effect of the restriction will vary according to the way in which the cards fall. Sometimes favourable combinations will appear, sometimes unfavourable; and the success or failure of the attempt will depend therefore on the chance arragement in which the cards may happen to be. In the carrying out this general principle, however, there are two varieties of games adopted, which differ materially in the nature of interest they offer to the player. In one class of games the result is determined by chance alone, without any power of the player to modify it; in the other class, oppurtunity is introduced for the excercise of <i>skill</i>. In the former the player has nothing to do but to follow strictly the given process and to abide the result; in the latter he has operations to perform which he may do in different ways according to his pleasure; and thus, although the chance fall of the cards still have an important effect, yet he may considerably influence the result of his moder of play.”<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>

		<p class="top">The most frequent object of a Patience Game is to arrange the cards in regular order of sequence, either from a low card to a higher (as from Ace to King), in which case they are said to be of <i>ascending</i> sequence; or from a high card to a lower (as from King to Ace), in which case they are said to be in <i>descending</i> sequence. Occasionally both forms of sequence are aimed at in the same game. The card which forms the starting point of the required sequence is known as the “foundation” card, and the sequence (or “family”) is said to be “built up” on such card. In some cases the foundation cards are picked out and placed in position beforehand; in others they are only laid down as they come to hand in course of play. In some instances it is a condition that the cards forming the sequence shall be all of the same suit as the foundation card; in others the distinction of suit is disregarded. Some games permit the provisional formation of what are called <i>auxiliary</i> sequences (descending or ascending as the case may be), <i>i.e.</i>, groups of two, three, or more cards in regular order of succession as between themselves, but not yet ripe, by reason of the absence of some intervening link, to be played to either of the “families”, or sequences formed on the foundation cards.</p>

		<p class="top">There is another class of Patience Games in which the player does not seek to form sequences, but merely to “pair” cards. The cards thus paired are thrown aside, and if he is able, under the limitations of the particular game, to throw out all the cards in this way he has won. There is yet another class of Patiences in which the player is entitled to throw out or otherwise dispose of any two cards which together form a particular number, say eleven or thirteen — his success, as before, depending upon his being able to get rid of all the cards in this manner.</p>

		<p class="top">It will be obvious that the endeavour thus to arrange, pair, or combine the cards of a whole pack is a matter of considerable difficulty, varying in degree according to the restrictions of the particular game. The player must therefore, particularly if a novice, be prepared for a good many failures, sometimes when he appears to have all but reached the goal of success. Hence, doubtless, the special appropriation of the name of <i>Patience</i> Games to recreations of this description.</p>

		<p class="top">The majority of Patience Games were originally played with the ordinary whist pack of 52 cards, though in some, mostly of continental origin, the piquet or bezique pack of 33 cards only (consisting of the ace, seven, eight, nine, ten, knave, queen, and king of each suit) is used. Of late years there has been a tendency, however, more frequently to use two whist packs shuffled together. The practice has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the greater bulk of cards is somewhat awkward to handle, and demands an inconvenient amount of table-space for its development. On the other, the fact that there are eight, instead of four cards of each denomination gives greater variety, and the fact that eight sequences are in course of simultaneous formation tends, or seems to tend (for the advantage is sometimes more apparent than real), in favour of the player. In any case, the use of the two packs makes undoubtedly 3 livelier game.</p>

		<p class="top">By way of conclusion to this brief introduction it may be well, once for all, to explain certain terms which are more or less peculiar to Patience Games, and which we shall have frequent occasion to use in our description.</p>
		The preliminary arrangement on the table of the prescribed number of cards or heaps of cards (before the actual play begins), is known as the tableau, or lay-out The diagrams prefixed to the descriptions which follow represent the <i>tableaux</i> of the respective games described,

		<p class="top">The cards in hand not employed in the formation of the tableau, or remaining for the time being unplayed, constitute the <i>stock</i>, or <i>talon</i>.<a href="#ref-dagger" id="cit-dagger">†</a></p>

		<p class="top">In the course of play, each card of the stock is in due succession turned up. If the rules of the particular game permit it is “played”, usually to a principal or auxiliary sequence. If its nature does not allow of its being so played, it is laid face upwards in front of the player, the cards so deposited being known as the “waste-” or “rubbish-heap”. Many writers on Patience Games (including the author of the work from which the following pages are translated), have fallen into the error of regarding the waste-heap as still forming part of the <i>talon</i>, and included under its name, thereby gratuitously complicating their descriptions. When the waste-heap is (according to a license permitted in many Patiences) again gathered up in the hand for a second distribution it may fairly be referred to as the stock or <i>talon</i>, but under no other circumstances.</p>

		<p class="top">A card dealt face upwards is known as an “exposed” or “faced” card; a card dealt face downwards as a “covered” card, even though no other card be laid upon it.</p>

		<p class="top">In some games certain cards are beforehand thrown out, no use being made of them in the game in question. These are known as “dead” cards.</p>

		<p class="top">When the player reaches a point at which he can make no further prepress, he is said to be "blocked", or, less elegantly, "checkered". This in many cases terminates the game. In others some form of indulgence is allowed, either in the shape of a fresh deal or otherwise, to give the player a further chance of success.</p>

		<p class="top">The games described in the following pages are of varying degrees of difficulty, but no attempt has been made to classify them, save by reference to the number of cards employed. Those played with the piquet pack are first described; then those with a single whist pack, and finally those for which two whilst packs are necessary.</p>

		<p class="top">It may now and then strike the reader that the instructions given are almost unnecessarily minute. For this peculiarity the German original must be held responsible. If it be a fault, it is one on the right side, and it has been thought wiser to make no attempt to correct it.</p>

		<p class="top">The question of Titles is one which presents some difficulty. Many of the Patiences here described have twin-brothers, scarcely to be distinguished from them, but known in England under different names. There are, however, almost always minute differences of detail between them, and on the whole it has been thought better to adhere to the nearest equivalents of the German titles.</p>

		<p class="top bottom">Even among English players there are innumerable diversities of practice on more or less important points, such as whether the stock is to be held face up or face down, whether and how often a waste-heap may be re-dealt, or the precise limitation of the “graces” allowed to the player. There is no central authority which can claim to make an absolute rule on such points, and meanwhile the average player is usually a law unto himself, and plays the one way or the other for no better reason than because he has always done so. Upon the first point above mentioned, however, there is the eminent authority of “Cavendish” for holding the stock <i>face upwards</i>. This is a distinct advantage to the player, as enabling him always to see “one card ahead”, and the practice is recommended for general adoption. The player, however, is not entitled to see any card of the stock beyond the one he has just removed and the one thereby brought into view. With auxiliary heaps and with the waste-heap the rule is different. These he is entitled to examine, and to study their order, and the better to do this he is recommended to deal them, where space permits, after such fashion that they may overlap, each card leaving its predecessor partially visible.</p>
