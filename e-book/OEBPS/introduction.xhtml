		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">P</span>ATIENCE GAMES, as the term is usually understood, are card games for a single player who plays against fate or chance, represented by the more or less favourable arrangement of the cards at the outset of the game.</p>
		<p>“The player at starting sets himself the task to arrange the cards in some particular manner; then, taking the pack in the accidental state determined by thorough shuffling, he attempts to  carry out his design, conforming, however, to certain rules of play” — varying with the particular game — “which materially restrict the facilities of his operation. The effect of the restriction will vary according to the way in which the cards fall. Sometimes favourable combinations will appear, sometimes unfavourable; and the success or failure of the attempt will depend therefore on the chance arragement in which the cards may happen to be. In the carrying out this general principle, however, there are two varieties of games adopted, which differ materially in the nature of interest they offer to the player. In one class of games the result is determined by chance alone, without any power of the player to modify it; in the other class, oppurtunity is introduced for the excercise of <i>skill</i>. In the former the player has nothing to do but to follow strictly the given process and to abide the result; in the latter he has operations to perform which he may do in different ways according to his pleasure; and thus, although the chance fall of the cards still have an important effect, yet he may considerably influence the result of his moder of play.”<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>
		<p>The most frequent object of a Patience Game is to arrange the cards in regular order of sequence, either from a low card to a higher (as from Ace to King), in which case they are said to be of <i>ascending</i> sequence; or from a high card to a lower (as from King to Ace), in which case they are said to be in <i>descending</i> sequence.</p>
