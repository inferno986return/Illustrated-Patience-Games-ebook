		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE object of the player in this game is to form ascending suit-sequences on the eight aces.</p>
		<p>The two packs having been shuffled together, the player, holding the cards face upwards, lays them out in horizontal rows of twelve, each row slightly overlapping its predecessor. Any ace which may come to hand during this process in either the first two or last two <i>vertical</i> rows is laid by itself, to form one of the foundations, and the next card is dealt in its place. A deuce, occuring in one of the above-mentioned rows, or any other card in sequence with a card already played to a foundation, is in like manner carried at once to its proper position. With these exceptions the deal proceeds, row by row, â€™till all the cards have been dealt out.</p>
