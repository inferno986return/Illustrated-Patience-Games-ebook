		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">H</span>AVING duly shuffled and cut the pack, you turn up the cards one by one, until you come to a queen, when you place it in the position of the corresponding queen in the figure. When all four queens have thus taken up their positions, you in like manner place the fives and sixes as indicated by the figure.</p>
		<p>Upon the sixes you then place, as they chance to come to hand, the sevens, eights, and so on, in ascending sequence and duly following suit, up to the knaves. Upon the fives you place, in descending sequence, the fours, threes, twos and aces of their respective suits, and on the aces the kings.</p>
		<p>If you are able to proceed as above until the kings and knaves lie beside their respective queens, the game is won, but if after dealing three times through the waste-heap, you have not yet attained this object, it is lost.</p>
