		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HIS is the parent game, from which all the rest have sprung.</p>
		<p>After thorough shuffling, as above recommended, deal the cards face upwards, one by one into four heaps in a row. You are not however bound to from all four heaps immediately. Thus if the first card dealt should be King, and the a Queen, you would, with a view to more convenient future use, place the Queen upon the King, and if a Knave next turned up, you would place it on the Queen. The Aces, as they appear, are placed in a second row below the first. On these, as appropriate cards appear, either on the four upper heaps or in the course of the deal, you play the twos, on the twos the threes, and so on, the object of the game being to form on the Aces complete ascending sequences, regardless of suit. Cards dealt, and not at once playable to either of the ace heaps, are laid on one or other of the four original heaps, the player of course endeavouring in this case to lay lower cards on higher ones, that they may be more easily playable to the ace heaps afterwards.</p>
		<p>The player is allowed for his better guidance to examine the contents of either of the heaps, but he must not disturb their order. Even with this privilege, however, the game is a difficult one, and success is less frequent than failure.</p>
