		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been duly shuffled and cut, select any suit you please to form your first circle. We will suppose that, as shown in the figure, the choice has fallen on <i>diamonds</i>. Turn up the cards one by one, and whenever a diamond appears place it in the position indicated by its value (corresponding to the “hours” on a clock-face). When you chance to turn up a card of any other suit, but of the same value as a diamond already in position, you place it on the latter, subject to the following qualification, viz., that upon a red card you can only place a black one, and on a black a red one. Thus on the six of diamonds you can only lay the six of spades or six of clubs; and on the six of spades or six of clubs the six of hearts only. At the close of the game, if you have been successful, there will be on each of the twelve “hours” of the clock-face (as also in the centre, which is the place of the kings) four cards alike in value, but red and black
		alternately.</p>
		<p>The cards not placed fall to a waste-heap, and you are entitled to go twice through such waste-heap (exclusive of the original deal).</p>
		<p class="bottom">This same game may also be played with <i>two</i> whist packs, arranged in like manner. In this case you are entitled to deal three times through the waste-heap, and each heap will consist of eight (instead of four) cards, of alternate colours.</p>
