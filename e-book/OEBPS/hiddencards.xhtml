		<p class="noindent top"><span class="initial">T</span>HE cards having been shuffled and cut, you deal out two rows of six each, face upwards, counting the first card as <i>ace</i>, the second <i>two</i>, and so on up to <i>six</i> for the first row; from <i>seven</i> up to <i>queen</i> for the second; then, placing the thirteenth card at the right hand, <i>face downwards</i> as shown in the figure, deal twelve more cards, one on each of the twelve cards in the two rows; on the thirteenth, which you put on one side, you place another, also face downwards. You repeat the operation until each of the thirteen heaps consists of four cards, and the stock is completely exhausted.</p>
		<p>You now take the uppermost card of the first heap (the left of the top row), and place it under the heap corresponding to its value. Thus if it be a six you will place it under the sixth heap, if an ace under the <i>first</i> heap, if a queen under the <i>twelfth</i>, and so on. The card thus hidden becomes the bottom card of that heap. Next, from the heap under which you have placed such card, you take the top card, and slip it under the heap corresponding to its own value, and so on throughout. If a king presents itself, you place it below the two rows, in the position shown in the diagram, and take in its place one of the cards of the reserve (the four turned-down cards), which you place under the heap corresponding to its value.</p>
		<p class="bottom">For the Patience to succeed, the twelve heaps, from ace up to queen, must follow each other in regular order of sequence, each heap consisting of four like cards, the four kings forming a thirteenth heap, placed below the others.<a href="#ref-asterisk" id="cit-asterisk">*</a></p>

		<p class="ref"><a href="#cit-asterisk" id="ref-asterisk">*</a> A very similar game is described by Dr. Pole (<i>Cyclopædia of Card and Table Games</i>) under the title of <span class="sc">5. All Fours</span>. The cards are in this case dealt <i>face downwards</i> in thirteen heaps; the uppermost card of each being turned up in due course, and placed <i>face upwards</i> under the heap indicated by its number. There is no reserve, but in the event of the player coming to a standstill by reason that the card which he should in ordinary course turn up is <i>already turned</i>, (as would be the case if four cards in succession had already been played to that particular heap) he may begin afresh by taking the top card of the first of the heaps still uncompleted, placing it under its proper number, and so going on as before. If when the player has done this, it happens that any card lies, still unfaced, on its proper heap, and only requires turning over, he may turn it accordingly. But if it requires moving to another heap, he has lost the game.</p>
